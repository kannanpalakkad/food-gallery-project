        <h1>falooda </h1>
        <p>A falooda is a Mughlai cuisine version of a cold dessert
             made with noodles.[1][2] It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, 
             variants of which are found across West, Central, and South Asia.[3] 
             Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk,
              often served with ice cream.[4] The vermicelli used for preparing falooda is made
               from wheat,[5] arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago.[6] </p>
